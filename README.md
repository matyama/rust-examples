# Rust Examples
This repository contains support materials for Rust tech-talks explaining various techniques and Rust specificts.

## Topics and Concepts
* *Static* vs *dynamic* dispatch
* *Ownership* and memory management
	* `Box`, `Rc` and their `Clone` semantics
* Type system features:
	* Enums as Algebraic Data Types
	* Pattern matching
	* Failure effects as types: `Option` instead of `null` pointer,
		`Result` instead of recoverable exceptions
	* (Bounded) Parametric polymorphism
	* Zero-cost abstraction
	* Types as carriers of (static) semantics
